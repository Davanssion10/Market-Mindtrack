Consumers increasingly opted for versatile bakeware that could withstand both the oven and the refrigerator.</li></ul><p>By 2022, the demand for glass bakeware was at an all-time high, with key players like Pyrex, Anchor Hocking, and Glasslock driving much of the market share.</p><h2>Future Outlook: 2023-2033</h2><p>Looking ahead to the next decade, the glass bakeware market is poised for further transformation.
