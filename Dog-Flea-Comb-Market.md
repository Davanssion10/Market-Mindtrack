The demand for flea combs surged during peak flea season, which often coincided with warmer months, driving seasonal spikes in sales.</p><ul> <li><strong>Increase in Pet Ownership:</strong> With more people adopting pets, particularly during the pandemic, there was a marked rise in the need for pet grooming products, including flea combs. This boosted market growth.</li> <li><strong>Natural Pet Care Trends:</strong> The shift toward natural, eco-friendly, and sustainable grooming products led to an uptick in flea comb sales, as they fit with these growing consumer preferences.</li> <li><strong>Online Retail Growth:</strong> E-commerce platforms became a key channel for flea comb sales, providing greater accessibility and convenience for customers.</li></ul><h2>What’s Driving the 2023-2033 Dog Flea Comb Market?</h2><p>As we look ahead to the next decade, several key factors will shape the dog flea comb market:</p><ul> <li><strong>Rising Pet Ownership and Humanization of Pets:</strong> The ongoing trend of treating pets as family members is expected to continue.
